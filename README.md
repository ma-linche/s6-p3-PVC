## Project Overview and Objectives

Testing our pipeline.

A client, a small travel agency,  recently contracted Slalom to deploy a proof-of-concept Java API to AWS to determine the feasibility of leveraging the Cloud for their IT operations. The client has since agreed to move forward with migrating their entire on-premises data center to AWS. 

The client engineers currently use manual processes to move code from their local development environment to their on-premises production servers. They have raised concerns that their manual processes are time-consuming and prone to human error. Additionally, the development teams have recently adopted the Agile methodology, requiring them to deploy code more frequently. The client is looking for a Slalom team to architect, develop and deploy a modern CI/CD pipeline prior to the client undergoing their large scale migration effort. The client is excited about adding automation to the build, test, and deploy stages of the release process. The CI/CD pipeline will mitigate the risks involved in releasing software to production. 

## Deliverables

1. **Code Repository** :
    1. All working code needed to support the development and setup of a CI/CD pipeline
    2. Technical documentation that can be referenced by the client to onboard their developers
2. **Backlog** :  Prioritized backlog with defined  stories at a level of detail that can be estimated efficiently.
3. **Cloud Infrastructure** : All infrastructure depicted in the previous sprints' architecture diagram is provisioned in an AWS account and client is provided a URL to the deployed application. 
4. **Presentation** : Final presentation to client stakeholders to review deliverables, demo application, and answer any outstanding questions.
Requirements

## Tools:

**Jira**:
For agile project management, you will use Jira. This sprint your pod is responsible for creating the user stories needed to complete the desired solution.  See the provided How To – Jira Project Management guide in the Project Management section of the Teams knowledge management folder for more information on how to set this up. 

**GitHub / Git** :
You can use GitHub for version control for your code. Once you’re logged in to GitHub, you can create a new repository for your pod. 

**Visual Studio Code** :
We encourage you to use Visual Studio Code as the IDE for this sprint.
